# API Configuration
# Development URL (when running backend locally)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Production URLs (uncomment and modify for production):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Note: When deploying to production:
# 1. Make sure this matches your backend's URL
# 2. Ensure the backend's CORS settings include your frontend's domain
# 3. Use HTTPS in production for security
